Exploring git and learning more code.

Coding can be fun! With the right tools and interesting problems.
GitHub is the hub for those tools and 'problems', or sorry projects.

Creating a repository, creating a branch, making and committing changes, making a pull request, and merging a pull request are examples of interesting thing to do on GitHub, well 5 of them.
Now, I am doing the third; making and committing changes.
